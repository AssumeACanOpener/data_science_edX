[Course website.](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT210x+4T2016/info)

### Module 2

Pandas basics, loading files, slicing, munging data.

### Module 3

Data visualization using Matplotlib.

### Module 4

Feature reduction using PCA and Isomap.

### Module 5

Clustering: unsupervised learning via K Means clustering, along with feature scaling and feature reduction.

KNN: Classification with K Nearest Neighbors.

* assignment5.py - classifying wheat types based on physical features
* assignment6.py - feature reduction, classifying images of faces
* assignment7.py - feature scaling, feature reduction, classifying breast cancer malignancy based on physical features of cells

LinearRegrassion: Classification with Linear Regression

* assignment8.py - Predicting life expectancy based on historical life expectancies
* assignment9.py - Data from various colleges, fitting features such as failure rate, as a linear function of separate features such as enrolled students
* assignment10.py - feature reduction, extrapolating sections of wav files of spoken numbers

### Module 6

SVM: Support Vector Machines

* assignment1.py - comparing svm.SVC to K Nearest Neighbors
* assignment2.py - optical recognition of numbers
* assignment3.py - predicting parkinsons disease and tuning the svm.SVC model (feature scaling currently produces bad results).

DecisionTrees: Decision Tree classifier

* assignment1.py - continuation of assignment 1 that also compares decision trees to svm.SVC and KNN.
* assignment5.py - classifying mushrooms as poisonous or not based on physical features.  Visualization of decision trees.

RandomForest: Random Forest classifier

* assignment6.py - classifying activity types based on physical measurements
